# project-paradise
a simple project I came up with.

What's this project?
- It's a project I came up with by creating a website based on my OC. Website will contain simple details, such as characters, worlds, entities and lore.

When will this project be finished?
- Honestly, I don't know. Web development is something new to me (or is it? who knows), so I'm trying to explore more. I will try my best to finish it in the future, (finished date unknown)

Why did you chose to create this project?
- So that in the future, the interviewers will think I'm an efficient worker ðŸ˜Ž. No seriously, it's about damn time I work on something real.
